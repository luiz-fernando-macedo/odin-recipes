    <h1>Japanese-Style Triple-Seared Steak Recipe</h1>
    <p>This Japanese-style triple-seared steak technique may sound like 2 sears too many, but it is not. It is an absolute game-changer that produces an incredibly delicious steak with a beautiful crust.</p>
    <p>Over the years I’ve developed a pretty decent chef-radar for identifying what new recipes and techniques are gimmicks or fleeting fads, and which are actual culinary breakthroughs, and when I first heard about Japanese-style triple-seared steak, I thought for sure it was the latter. I’ve never been so happy to be wrong. </p>
    <p>This technique may sound like two sears too many, but it’s definitely not. The salt, then whiskey, then soy searing method is an absolute game-changer that produces an incredibly flavorful steak with a thick, beautiful crust. This is a must make for any steak lover, and would be perfect for treating Dad on Father’s Day. But, no matter the occasion, I loved everything about this, and really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) center-cut filet mignon, fully trimmed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon avocado oil or other high heat oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coarse sea salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Japanese whiskey, or other bourbon or rye whiskey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great choices. The coals should be glowing red, and radiating extreme heat before the meat hits the grill.</li>
        <li>Rub steak all over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area is completely covered.</li>
        <li>Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place steak on hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer steak into bowl of whiskey, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute. Most of the salt will rinse off.</li>
        <li>Place steak back onto the hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides again, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. You can baste steak with a small amount of whiskey while searing.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce to another shallow bowl. Add steak to the bowl, and turn constantly for at least 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Return steak to the hottest spot on the grill for the 3rd and final sear. Grill both sides for about 2 1/2 minutes, or until desired doneness is reached. For a rosy-pink inside, remove when an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 118 to 120 F (48 to 50 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Brush steak with melted butter, and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Slice and serve with any accumulated juices from the plate.</li>
    </ol>
